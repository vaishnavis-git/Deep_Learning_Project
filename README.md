# AI-Generated Poster Text Correction Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing text generation and text editing on AI-generated posters. Despite advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, issues like incorrect text spelling and formatting remain prevalent. Our solution aims to correct text on AI-generated images while preserving the original font and style, extend corrections to indic languages, and improve overall text accuracy without unwanted artifacts.

## Objectives
- **Text Correction**: Correct misspellings and improperly generated text in AI-generated posters and images while maintaining the original font and style.
- **Text Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary or unwanted text by accurately inpainting those regions
